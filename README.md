## General Information
I made this script because I didn't want to spend a long time manually opening boxes that I've collected in Overwatch. It would've been easier to make something hold down the spacebar key but that isn't nearly as interesting as this!


## How to use it
All you need to do is run main.py which will ask you for the number of boxes you want to open. After inputting the number of boxes you want open, you should have about 5 seconds to tab over to your Overwatch application and have the loot box opening menu loaded up. After the 5 seconds are over, the script will do its thing while you can AFK until it is complete.

For those of you that want screenshots of your loot, main.py will save screenshots to the loot folder. 

### WARNING:
1. It is important that you do not mess with the current_num.txt file.
